## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to understand what factors affect video game sales. Using real-world data, this project explores trends and builds predictive models to help forecast global sales based on features such as genre, platform, and ratings.

---

## Executive Summary
This analysis uses a Kaggle dataset of 16,000+ video game records to explore what makes a video game successful.  
We examined how genre, platform, critic score, and user score influence global sales through data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and Excel-based A/B simulations.  

**Key Findings:**
- Critic scores â‰¥80 strongly influence higher global sales (verified via A/B simulation).  
- Decision Tree performed best among predictive models (RÂ² = 0.692).  
- Regional preferences: NA favors shooters/sports, JP favors RPGs.  
- Cluster analysis showed most games sell modestly, with only a few blockbusters dominating sales.

## Excel Dashboard & A/B Simulation
- **Dashboard:** Visualized trends across genres, platforms, and regions.  
- **A/B Testing:** Compared games with critic scores â‰¥80 against lower-rated games, confirming higher sales performance.  
- **Insights:** Helped identify top-performing titles, optimal release timing, and regional market strategies.

## Model Building Process
1. **Define the Problem** â€“ Predict global video game sales and identify key success factors.  
2. **Data Collection** â€“ Kaggle dataset (16,000+ records, including global/regional sales, genre, platform, scores).  
3. **EDA** â€“ Visualization of trends, correlations, and top-performing categories.  
4. **Modeling** â€“ Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering.  
5. **Evaluation** â€“ MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² used to assess performance.  
6. **Deployment** â€“ Insights for developers and publishers to inform future game planning.

## Model Evaluation

| Model | MAE | RMSE | RÂ² |
|-------|-----|------|----|
| Linear Regression | 0.403 | 1.445 | 0.504 |
| Decision Tree | 0.202 | 1.139 | 0.692 |
| Lasso Regression | 0.202 | 1.445 | 0.5041 |

**Conclusion:**  
Decision Tree outperformed other models, providing the most accurate predictions and explaining ~69% of variance in global sales.

## Clustering Results

**K-Means (K=3):**
- Cluster 0: Majority of games with low sales.  
- Cluster 1: High critic scores but moderate sales.  
- Cluster 2: Top-selling hits (outliers).  

**Hierarchical Clustering:**  
Provided additional grouping confirmation but added limited new insight.

## Learning Algorithms Implemented
- **Linear Regression:** Baseline predictive model.  
- **Lasso Regression:** Feature selection.  
- **Decision Tree:** Variable importance and non-linear relationships.  
- **K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering:** Unsupervised grouping based on sales and scores.
